I’m happy to chat about possible collaborations. If you are a student at USC, please feel free to email me (and check with your advisor). If you are interested in becoming a PhD student at USC, please apply to the Data Sciences and Operations PhD program if you’d like to work with me, specifically the Operations PhD program, and mention my name. 

I'm very fortunate to work with many collaborators, including junior colleagues: 

Michelle Bao
David Bruns-Smith
Defu Cao
Wenshuo Guo
Andrew Koo 
Ezinne Nwankwo
Luyang Zhang
