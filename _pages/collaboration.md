I’m happy to chat about possible collaborations. If you are a student at USC, please feel free to email me (and check with your advisor). If you are interested in becoming a PhD student at USC, please apply to the Data Sciences and Operations PhD program if you’d like to work with me, specifically the Operations PhD program, and mention my name. 

I'm very fortunate to work with many collaborators, including junior colleagues: 

Michelle Bao

David Bruns-Smith

Defu Cao

Wenshuo Guo

Andrew Koo 

Ezinne Nwankwo

Luyang Zhang

I am also eager to connect with industrial/practice-oriented partners. I am always excited to translate relevant insights from previous research to your specific insights. I have worked in A/B testing at scale in advertising technology. I have also worked in translational collaboration with social impact practitioners (social services/criminal justice).
