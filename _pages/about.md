I am an Assistant Professor at USC Marshall Data Sciences and Operations, in the Operations group. 

Previously I was a research fellow at the Simons program on causality and a FODSI postdoc at UC Berkeley. I obtained my PhD from Cornell University in [Operations Research and Information Engineering](http://www.orie.cornell.edu) working with [Nathan Kallus](nathankallus.com) at Cornell Tech. My work was previously supported on a NDSEG fellowship.

My research interests are broadly in data-driven decision making under uncertainty, including operations, statistical machine learning, and causal inference, and the interplay of statistics and optimization.
