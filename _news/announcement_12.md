Delighted to share that my paper on [Optimal and Fair Encouragement Policy Evaluation and Learning
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07176.pdf) is accepted at Neurips 2023! TL;DR: often, especially in social services, under incomplete take-up, we care both about utilitarian policy measures and who gets access to services. Let's work together to [equitably reduce administrative burdens](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-regulatory-affairs/burden-reduction-initiative/). See you in New Orleans!
